## What

This is a simple implementation of
[Agile Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)
in your browser.

After sharing a unique URL with your remote team members, every user can enter
their estimation. The result will only be revealed once everybody has given
an estimate.

## How

* [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)
* [socket.io](http://socket.io/)

## Demo

http://estimation-poker.pixelistik.de

However, this is running on a very small Heroku dyno, so it might be slow.

After opening the page, copy the URL from the address bar and open it in another
browser session (or actually give it to a colleague).
